# NTLM_Generator_and-_Cracker
Generates and Runs Dictionary attacks againt Windows NTLM Hashes

<br>
There's two command line arguments
<br>
-crack - Will ask for a dictonary file and then a hash
<br>
-gen - Will ask for a string to be converted into a NTLM Hash.
<br>
<br>
This code may be later added to passgen and this repository will stand as a experimental feature repo for other attacks on hash based cryptographic attacks before being added to the mainline passgen repo.
